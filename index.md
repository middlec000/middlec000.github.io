# Interests
* Personalized Medicine - Each one of us is different. We often present different symptoms for the same condition and we respond differently to the same medicine. Data science is the answer - if we learn what information determines these differences and find ways to collect it passively it can be used to more effectively and efficiently treat and prevent negative health outcomes.   

* Negative Socioeconomic Outcome Prevention - Preventing individuals from experiencing negative socioeconomic outcomes such as homelessness is more humane and cost-effective than waiting to assist people only after they have reached the negative outcome, such as losing their homes. See my Predicting Homelessness project below.

* Data Science Tools - I always enjoy learning new tools to help extract, investigate, transform, and visualize data, fit models, and present results.

* Outdoors - I am currently living in Leavenworth, Washington, and enjoying exploring the surrounding mountains.

## [Predicting Homelessness (Pending Publication)](https://github.com/middlec000/SPA_predict_homelessness)
Used a logistic regression model to predict an individual's risk of experiencing homelessness based on their utility payment history.  
Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## [The Wordler](https://github.com/middlec000/wordler)
A website that suggests words for you to use for the New York Times Wordle game based on your previous guesses and ranked by frequency of use.  
Tools: Python (streamlit, pandas)

## [One-Way ANOVA Website](https://share.streamlit.io/middlec000/grades_vs_student_characteristic/main/src/main.py)
Upload your data, group it by a categorical column, then determine if there is a statistically significant difference in means of a continuous variable between groups. Example provided.  
Tools: Python (streamlit, pandas, statsmodels)

## [Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/middlec000/wine_quality)
Used a random forest model to classify wine into one of six quality rankings based on given attributes.  
Tools: R (Hmisc, corrplot, randomForest, caret, ggplot2)
