\section{Education}
\subsection{{Master of Science in Applied Mathematics  \hfill September 2019 --- June 2021}}
\subtext{Eastern Washington University \hfill Cheney, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item GPA: 4.0
    \item Awards: Outstanding Graduate (2021), Graduate Service Appointment (2020 - 2021)
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Bachelor of Science in Mathematics \hfill September 2013 --- December 2017}}
\subtext{Western Washington University \hfill Bellingham, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item GPA: 3.5
    \item Minor: Chemistry
    \item Awards: Honors Program Graduate, Math Fellow (2015 - 2017), Presidential Scholarship (2013)
\end{zitemize}

\section{Project Experience}
\subsection{{Data Analyst / The Wordler \hfill March 2022 --- Present}}
\subtext{Personal Project \hfill Leavenworth, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Acquired list of words from Wordle website source code and word frequencies from Kaggle dataset.
    \item Built 6 component data filter using regular expressions in Python.
    \item Published user-friendly Streamlit website to suggest Wordle words for users.
    \item Words sorted and displayed by user preference: Word Frequency, Letter Frequency, Letter Position Frequency.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Data Science Lead / Homelessness Prediction \hfill June 2020 --- June 2021}}
\subtext{Spokane Predictive Analytics and Master's Thesis Project \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Received, matched on composite key, and preprocessed 4,785,131 rows of de-identified data from 8 csv files.
    \item Communicated with data providers to improve datasets over 5 iterations.
    \item Performed exploratory data analysis on the monthly billing data representing 91,591 people over a 5-year period using visualization techniques and 4 types of correlation to discover relationships and trends.
    \item Established data homogeneity across years using ranks of variable-outcome correlations.
    \item Engineered 2 new cumulative features and 3 new aggregate features.
    \item Investigated longitudinal prediction approaches using Linear Regression, Cox Proportional Hazards, and LSTM models.
    \item Investigated non-longitudinal prediction approaches using Logistic Regression and Vanilla ANN models.
    \item Evaluated and compared models based on Receiver Operator Characteristic curves and Area Under the Curve. The Logistic Regression model performed best with an AUC of 0.81 - similar to current research that incorporated richer data sources.
    \item Implemented K-Folds and minority class oversampling to make model performance more reproducible and combat extreme class imbalance - only 0.39\% of cases were of the positive class.
    \item Presented findings to the City Council of Spokane and defended as master's thesis.
    \item Paper pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.
\end{zitemize}

\newpage
\subsection{{Software Engineer / Academic Paper Clustering by Topic \hfill January 2021 --- March 2021}}
\subtext{Big Data Analytics Class Project, Eastern Washington University \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Established a data preprocessing pipeline that pulled the body of each paper, detected the language - retaining only English documents, tokenized and lemmatized each text, then converted all documents to sparse vectors of TF-IDF scores using Python.
    \item Assisted with development of a customized K-Means algorithm optimized for sparse, largely disjoint TF-IDF vectors.
    \item Developed component to find the number of clusters to form using the Elbow Method.
    \item Currently developing a fast hierarchical text document clustering Python package as an extension of this work.
\end{zitemize}
