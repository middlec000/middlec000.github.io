\subsection{{Data Science Lead / Homelessness Prediction \hfill June 2020 --- June 2021}}
\subtext{Spokane Predictive Analytics and Master's Thesis Project \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Received, matched on composite key, and preprocessed 4,785,131 rows of de-identified data from 8 csv files.
    \item Communicated with data providers to improve datasets over 5 iterations.
    \item Performed exploratory data analysis on the monthly billing data representing 91,591 people over a 5-year period using visualization techniques and 4 types of correlation to discover relationships and trends.
    \item Established data homogeneity across years using ranks of variable-outcome correlations.
    \item Engineered 2 new cumulative features and 3 new aggregate features.
    \item Investigated longitudinal prediction approaches using Linear Regression, Cox Proportional Hazards, and LSTM models.
    \item Investigated non-longitudinal prediction approaches using Logistic Regression and Vanilla ANN models.
    \item Evaluated and compared models based on Receiver Operator Characteristic curves and Area Under the Curve. The Logistic Regression model performed best with an AUC of 0.81 - similar to current research that incorporated richer data sources.
    \item Implemented K-Folds and minority class oversampling to make model performance more reproducible and combat extreme class imbalance - only 0.39\% of cases were of the positive class.
    \item Presented findings to the City Council of Spokane and defended as master's thesis.
    \item Paper pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.
